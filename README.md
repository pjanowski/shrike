Compliant Machine Learning is the practice of training, validating and deploying
machine learning models withou seeing the private data. It is needed in many
enterprises to satsify the strict compliance and privacy guarantees that 
they provide to their customers.

The library `shrike` is a set of Python utilities for compliant machine
learning, with a special emphasis on running pipeline in the platform of 
[Azure Machine Learning](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples). This
library mainly contains three components, that are

-  `shrike.compliant_logging`: utlities for compliant logging and 
exception handling;
-  `shrike.pipeline`: helper code for manging, validating and submitting Azure
Machine Learning pipelines based on 
[azure-ml-component](https://aka.ms/azure-ml-component-reference);
-  `shrike.build`: helper code for packaging, building, validating, signing and
registering Azure Machine Learning components.

## Documentation
For the full documentation of `shrike` with detailed examples and API reference, 
please see the [docs page](http://azure.github.io/shrike).

## Installation

The library `shrike` is publicly available in PyPi. There are three optional extra dependenciies - `pipeline`, `build` and `dev`, 
among which  `pipeline` is for submitting Azure Machine Learning pipelines, `build` is for signing and registering components, 
and `dev` is for the development environment of `shrike`.

- If only the compliant-logging feature would be used, please pip install without any extras:
```pwsh
pip install shrike
```
- If it will be used for signing and registering components, please type with `[build]`:
```pwsh
pip install shrike[build]
```
- If it will be used for submitting Azure Machine Learning pipelines, please type with `[pipeline]`:
```pwsh
pip install shrike[pipeline]
```
- If you would like to contribute to the source code, please install with all the dependencies:
```pwsh
pip install shrike[pipeline,build,dev]
```

## Migration from `aml-build-tooling`, `aml-ds-pipeline-contrib`, and `confidential-ml-utils`
If you have been using "aml-build-tooling", "aml-ds-pipeline-contrib", and `confidential-ml-utils` libraries, please use the migration script ([migration.py](https://github.com/Azure/shrike/blob/main/migration.py)) to convert your repo or file and adopt the `shrike` package with one simple command:
```pwsh
python migraton.py --input_path PATH/TO/YOUR/REPO/OR/FILE
```
:warning: This command will update files **in-place**. Please make a copy of your repo/file if you do not want to do so.
